# Bengine-MAESC
A repo to build a Bengine Docker image and run it in a microservice architecture.

#### Build only the Bengine image
You can build the image by itself by running the build.sh script.

#### Compose the Bengine & block images
You can use docker-compose to build, link, & run the Bengine image along with other block images. Use the `build.sh` to build the images you want in your microservice network. Use the `compose.sh` to jump-start your docker-compose network.
